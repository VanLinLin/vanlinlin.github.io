# 🧍‍♂️ Biography


Hello,
My name is Van, I am a senior student at National Chung Shing University, Taichung, Taiwan, majoring in Applied Mathematics. I'm also a prospective master's student and with the with the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/acvlab/">Advanced Computer Vision Laboratory (ACVLAB)</a> at the Institute of Data Science, National Cheng Kung University (NCKU), Tainan, Taiwan, and I have begun to participate in various competitions and research in the ACVLAB.

I possess a profound passion for Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Generative AI, etc, with a special emphasis on Computer Vision.

Moreover, I am also fascinated by the multimodal area, which combines multiple, different deep learning tasks to make a model learn more information from data to solve more complex problems.
